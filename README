MUMPS Implementation in Perl
This package implements a MUMPS to Perl compiler.
A script for interpreting and running MUMPS programs is now supplied.
Soon: an Apache perl module for MUMPS embedded web pages.
Note: this is a beta version, expect bugs.
The standard library is based on MumpsVM, another free MUMPS
implementation.
This package is free for use but not modification. This includes
production commercial use.
Please report bugs to schop@cpan.org

See the file INSTALL.
